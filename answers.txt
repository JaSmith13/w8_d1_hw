1. What is responsible for defining the routes of the `games` resource?

-The create_router.js file/ the gamesRouter

2. What do you notice about the folder structure?  Whats the client responsible for? Whats the server responsible for?

-The frontend and backend folders are completely separated into client and server folders, the client is responsible
for handling user input and performing business logic aswell as displaying information to the user, the server is 
responsible for processing requests made by the client and performing actions on the data in the database 

3. What are the the responsibilities of server.js?

-Running the express server, processing the routes from fetch requests made by the front end to the db and the server

4. What are the responsibilities of the `gamesRouter`?

-To translate the url from the fetch request to one that is usable by the create_router and allow the server to perform the correct operation

5. What process does the the client (front-end) use to communicate with the server?

-fetch requests/ request,response

6. What optional second argument does the `fetch` method take? And what is it used for in this application? Hint: See [Using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) on the MDN docs

-the second argument passed to a fetch is an object containing meta data or custom settings that can be applied to the request.
-In this case on the postGame function, the object is telling the server the type of request, defaults to GET, to expect a JSON 
body and the a stringified JSON object to be added

7. Which of the games API routes does the front-end application consume (i.e. make requests to)?

-GET ALL, POST & DELETE

8. What are we using the [MongoDB Driver](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/) for?

-The Driver is used to connect to connect the server to the mongoDB and interact with it

Ext. Why do we need to use [`ObjectId`](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/api-bson-generated/objectid.html) from the MongoDB driver?

-It is used to generate a unique key to differentiate between documents in the database
